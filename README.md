# Concept
Implementing a Computer Vision Deep Learning system able to upscale image up to 4 times their original dimension without quality loss.

The implementation is based on Colab Notebooks that could both be ran locally or on Google Colab.

The project both re-implements the [SRGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802) (Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network) architecture as a state-of-the-art method using tensorflow-keras to build the architecture and training/evaluation pipelines, and then explores a novel approach based on denoising techniques.

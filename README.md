- ExpressJS advanced RESTful APIs development (middlewares, cronjobs, DAOs to MongoDB Neo4j and Redis, authentication session management with redis)
- ReactJS advanced Frontend Programming (caching and state management using redux, middlewares capturing APIs answers and handling them with in-middle operations like notification of successful operations and failures)
- Multiple and Distributed Databases interactions and consistency using CAP theorem
- Advanced searching using MongoDB indexes

## DeckBuilder
Learned:
- Data Mining to collect card and matches information for ClashRoyale
- Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, and Feature Selection with scikit-learn, pandas, numpy and matplotlib
- Association Rule Mining and confidence usage for AI-based cards association
- Class rebalancing using both undersampling and oversampling (SMOTE)
- Classification methods and differences plotting the performances obtained in the scenario
- Usage of Association confidence to improve Rank classification
- Python Flask usage to implement RESTful APIs interfacing with MongoDB and Machine Learning scripts

## Distributed Systems
Learned:
- Erlang for distributed application services - Cowboy web sockets server through HTTP endpoints; Notification and Chat Registries for real-time coordination
- Docker advanced configuration of Development environments simulating the deployment environment through networking and docker-compose
- Java EJBs using DAOs and DTOs to interact with MySQL server
- Erlang MySQL handler process separated from Cowboy execution that handles queries asynchronously and coordinated through send/receive.
- Tomcat configuration and MVC web application development and deployment using JSPs and MySQL basic driver
- NGINX basic configuration for load balancing through IP-hashing over tomcat replicas to keep users' authorized sessions in the same server
- Final architecture deployment (2 instances of the tomcat server; 1 erlang server to handle chatrooms through registries; 1 erlang server to handle notifications through registries; 1 NGINX load balancer; 1 MySQL server for data persistency)

# Application Highlights

The application allows two types of user registrations and provides a library of songs directly linked to youtube videos.

- Common User
  Basic registration that allows to interact with public playlists filtering by parameters or statistics such as popularity and to create private playlists that can be published afterwards. A user can also indirectly add new songs by proposing new links and remove broken links by reporting them.
- Validator User
  Is an advanced type of account that can be chosen automatically by his popularity. This type of user is in charge of maintaining the songs library operating on them and managing reports and proposals.

The application also allows not registered user to view and search playlists and open their songs without interacting with them.
